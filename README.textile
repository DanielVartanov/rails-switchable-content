h2. Switchable content

ActionView helper. Provides easy creation of blocks hideable by checkboxes.


h3. Example

Just type in your view:

<pre><% switchable_content do %>
  <%= text_field :model, :field %>
  <%= text_area :model, :another_field %>
<% end %></pre>

You'll get a checkbox, which hides and shows two input fields mentioned above. Additional checkbox value is not added to HTTP request.

Please, see 'Usage details' below for an important note and a Haml example.


h3. Implementation details

<code>switchable_content</code> method simply does the following:

1. Surrounds HTML code returned by methods called inside the block with a <code><div></code> tag.
2. Adds a checkbox with 'onclick' javascript handler, which hides and shows the <code><div></code>.

For instance, the sample ERb code above returns the following HTML code:

<pre><div id="switchable_block_ad50a1a182345ec">
  <input id="model_field" name="model[field]" type="text" />
  <input id="model_another_field" name="model[another_field]" type="text" />
</div>

<input type="checkbox" onchange="block = document.getElementById('switchable_block_ad50a1a182345ec'); if (this.checked) {block.style.display='block'} else {block.style.display='none'}" /></pre>

You can create as many switchable blocks as you need on a single page, therefore a unique key is generated for each block (that "ad50a1a18..." in id). So, each checkbox hides and shows its own block.


h3. Installation

One-step installation:

<code>$ script/plugin install git://github.com/DanielVartanov/rails-switchable-content.git</code>


h3. Usage details

NOTE: line of code with switchable_content method call should start with <code><%-</code> (<code>-</code> in Haml), but lines of block content, on the contrary, with <code><%=</code> (<code>=</code> in Haml). In short words, use <code>switchable_content</code> exactly as <code>form_tag</code> and other similar methods.

For ERb example see above.
Here is a Haml example:

<pre>- switchable_content do
  = text_field :model, :field
  = text_area :model, :another_field</pre>
