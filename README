== Switchable content

Helper function for views. Allows to easly create blocks, hideable by checkbox.

== Example

Just type:

switchable_content do
  text_field :model, :field
  text_area :model, :another_field
end

And you'll get a checkbox, which hides and shows two inner input fields. Additional checkbox value is not added to HTTP request.

== Implementation details

The example ruby code above retunrs the following HTML code:

<input id="switchable_block_ad50a1a182345ec_switch" type="checkbox" name="" onchange="toggleSwitchableBlock('ad50a1a182345ec')" />

<div id="switchable_block_ad50a1a182345ec">
  <input id="model_field" name="model[field]" type="text" />
  <input id="model_another_field" name="model[another_field]" type="text" />
</div>

You can create as many switchable blocks as you need on a single page, so a unique key is generated for each block (those "ad50a1a..." in ids).

toggleSwitchableBlock(key) is a javascript function, which sets "display:none" or "display:inline" style of surrounding <div>.
